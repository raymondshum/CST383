# CST 383: Introduction to Data Science

> In data science, data analysis and machine learning techniques are applied to visualize data, understand trends, and make predictions. In this course, students will learn how to obtain data, preprocess it, apply machine learning methods, and visualize the results. A student who completes the course will have enough theoretical knowledge, and enough skill with modern statistical programming languages and their libraries, to define and perform complete data science projects.

## Description

This repository contains coursework for CST383. There are seven sets of labs and assignments labelled <code>Assignments/HW#</code> and <code>Labs/M#</code>. The appended digit indicates the "module" (week) number that the coursework was assigned. 

The homework assignments were passed through an autograder. The commented sections indicate the question, while the code immediately following each question represents the answer.

Lab work was more freeform and conducted either on a local Jupyter notebook or using Google Collab. We explored concepts relating to
that week's topics.

## Final Project

See our final project here: https://github.com/InnovaTree/cst-383-project-life-expectancy

Our final project was an exploration of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods in predicting life expectancy
using datasets provided by the WHO. We focused specifically on data cleansing, feature selection and feature engineering
over several successively improved linear regression models. Please visit the link for a more detailed walkthrough.
